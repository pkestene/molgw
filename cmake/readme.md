# Notes

- file `FindMKL.cmake` is borrowed from https://github.com/eth-cscs/cmake-recipes  
  Too bad, Intel does not provide its own FindMKL.cmake...
- file `FindLibint2.cmake` is borrowed from Ubuntu package, so that we can re-use it on other platform. It would be better if Libint2 install target would provide directly a `Libint2Targets.cmake`
